-- Migration v3: Switch to unified Supabase Auth for students
-- This updates the students table to use auth_user_id instead of pin_hash

-- Add auth_user_id column to students table
ALTER TABLE students 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS auth_user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_managed BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

-- Remove pin_hash column (no longer needed)
ALTER TABLE students 
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS pin_hash;

-- Create index for faster lookups
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_students_auth_user_id ON students(auth_user_id);

-- Update RLS policies for students table
